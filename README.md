## Description of the Project
The purpose of the application is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. This application can dynamically complete the following HTTP requests: get, post, put, and delete for categories, products, and tags. This application uses Node.js, MYSQL, DotEv and Express to run the application. Dotev is used to protect developer's passwords by placing their passwords in environment variables in .env file. This application requires you to understand package.json and its node_modules. In additon to that, gitignore file is important to use so certain folders and files are not upload to GitHub. For example, node_modules should not be uploaded to GitHub since this folder gets created during the installition process. Lastly, this project stands out since the application has its own server and can effectively retrieve data from the e-commerce database.

## Installation
To create this project, follow these several steps. This application uses Node.js, MYSQL (version 2.3.3), dotev (verison 8.2.0), and Express (verison 4.17.1). Step one, download Node.js. Next go to the terminal of the index.js and type this command ```npm install```. This creates package.json file and its dependencies. 


## Usage
To use this application, open the terminal, respective to the file. Run the ```npm run seed``` to populate the data tables with its respective seeds. Finally, type this command in the terminal ```node server.js``` to run the application. This allows the user to perform any HTTP method on categories, products, and tags.

This is what the index.html will look like when deployed.
